## A common backend for file-based data repositories

Everyone is talking about “FAIR”: Findable, Accessible, interoperable, Reusable. However, we live in a file-based world: traditionally, every research output is organized on the basis of individual files (or series of files) in local computer systems. The path “from file to FAIR” is usually not undertaken by the individual researcher, but files are left rotting on isolated hard disks.
 
The most advanced solutions for the organization of data according to community standards and according to the FAIR principles are curently achieved by domain-specific repositores, e.g. PDB for protein crystal strctures, ChEMBL for bioactivity data, or STRENDA-DB for enzymology data. These data repositories usually fulfill the following common tasks: storage of user inputs / data files, enforcing adherence to minimum information, extracting structured information from user inputs, providing view, search and export functionalities on basis of the structured information.
 
Although easily imaginable, there is not yet a blueprint available to provide those common functionalities in an easy and configurable fashion from open-source building blocks. I want to discuss whether this blueprint would be for you, what your requirements on such a solution would be, and what your concerns are.

### The Live Poll

During the LotF community call in September 2020, we conducted a live poll with the following questions:

2. At your work place, do you miss dedicated repositories for specific file types?
3. How much pain do you experience, when there is no dedicated repository for the specific data type you work with?
4. Would a common backend allow you to reduce the problems you experience?
5. How important do you consider it to create such a common backend?
6. How much would you support the idea of creating a common backend? 
7. Do you think the proposed technology stack is a good choice?
8. I am interested in working on this together with others.

The results are below:
